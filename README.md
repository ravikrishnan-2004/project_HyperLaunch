# Chocolate Sales Prediction

Project Overview:

  *This project aims to predict chocolate sales using machine learning. It utilizes a Random Forest Regression model to analyze historical sales data and make predictions on future sales. 
  
  *The project provides insights into sales trends, feature importance, and overall sales performance.

Objectives:

 * Train a machine learning model to predict chocolate sales.
   
 * Make predictions on new or future sales data.
   
 * Visualize actual vs. predicted sales, residual distribution, feature importance, and total sales by country.

installation:

  *pip pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scitkit-learn
  
Prepare Data:

  *chocolate sales data in a CSV file with the following columns: `Date`, `Country`, `Product`, `Sales Person`, and `Amount`.

feature:

   *Sales Predictions: The make predictions on new or future sales data.
   
   *Visualization: The visualizations to help you understand sales trends.
   
   *Actual vs. Predicted Sales: A scatter plot comparing the model's predictions with actual sales values.
   
   *Residual Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of prediction errors (residuals).
   
   *Feature Importance: A bar chart highlighting the most influential features in the sales prediction model.
   
   *Total Sales by Country: A bar chart displaying the total sales for each country.
